# InterviewScheduler

A simple app where admins can create interviews by selecting participants, interview start time and end time.

-> I have added a feature through which the admin can only select those participants which are available at the specified time slot so there is no possibility of the appearance of an error message in this case.

-> After an interview is created or edited, an email is sent to each of the participants.

-> I have added the option to upload the resume file inside the ‘create participant’ option.

-> I have assumed that while scheduling the interviews, it is necessary to schedule it in the future i.e. Start time of the interview should be greater than the current time.
